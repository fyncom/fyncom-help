## Funding your accounts

FynCom makes sure your funds are moved in the most efficient way possible. You deposit funds via a credit or debit card, and we take care of the rest. <br> 
This is why our platform is able to deliver rewards ranging from $0.0000000001 to $999. Any values larger than that require a simple form of identity verification.<br>
Here's how to start. 

1. **Add funds**
   1. Go to your [wallet page](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/wallet) and click "Add funds" to input your information. Payments are secured by Stripe. $5 minimum.
   ![Go to your wallet page]()
   2. Once your funds are added, you'll see your "Available Fiat Balance" increase accordingly.
2. **Cryptocurrency conversions are automated** 
   1. In order to reduce your exposure to crypto assests, FynCom converts $5 of crypto at a time. The first $5 is converted when you make your first campaign. <br>
   After that, your balance is reloaded anytime your "Available Crypto Funds" drops below $0.50. 
3. **Refunds**Once inside the Settings menu, select the "**Forwarding and POP/IMAP**" option

10. Here is the most important step. In the "**To**" field, enter the email address that should trigger a FynCom reward and then select "**Create filter**".
    1. Keep in mind that FynCom will see all incoming emails to this particular email address. We advise that you create an alias and use that for your marketing
    campaigns. If you are using GMail, [an alias can be made for free](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en) by simply adding "+" and some 
    characters after the "+", but before the ".com"<br>
    For example, if your typical email is "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE@gmail.com)", your alias can be 
    2. "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE+rewards@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE+rewards@gmail.com)" as shown in the image below.
       ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-12.png)

11. Now, you should see a drop-down menu with a list of checkboxes.
    1. Please select the "**Forward it to:**" checkbox
    2. Hit the drop down arrow and select the "[**rewards@rewards.fyncom.com**](mailto:rewards@rewards.fyncom.com)" email
    3. Select "**Create filter**"
       ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-13.png)

[//]: # (todo update this picture with the actual new email forwaridng address.)
12. If everything went right, you should be taken back to the "**Filters and Blocked Addresses**" page and the newly created filter should appear at the bottom. You can do this for as many alias emails as you want. At this point, you are ready to begin sending rewards for responses to these emails. Now you can go to the [FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) to set up your triggers and values.
