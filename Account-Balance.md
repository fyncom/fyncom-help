## Funding your accounts

FynCom makes sure your funds are moved in the most efficient way possible. You deposit funds via a credit or debit card, and we take care of the rest. <br> 
This is why our platform is able to deliver rewards ranging from $0.0000000001 to $999. Any values larger than that require a simple form of identity verification.<br>
Here's how to start.

1. **Add funds**
   1. Go to your [wallet page](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/wallet) and click "Add funds" to input your information. Payments are secured by Stripe. $5 minimum.
   2. Once your funds are added, you'll see your "Available Fiat Balance" increase accordingly.
<br>
2. **Cryptocurrency conversions are automated** 
   1. In order to reduce your exposure to crypto assests, FynCom converts $5 of crypto at a time. The first $5 is converted when you make your first campaign. <br>
   After that, your crypto balance is automatically reloaded from your fiat balance anytime your "Available Crypto Funds" drops below $0.50 or if your reward requires more crypto funds.
