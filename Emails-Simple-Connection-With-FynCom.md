# Connecting Email Address with FynCom For Single Rewards

--------

**\*The only emails that will be able to trigger FynCom rewards are the ones you registered in the** [**FynCom dashboard**](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/)**.

## Setting up your email for "Simple Rewards" Email.

Note: Since anyone who replies to this email will receive a reward from the most recent Reward Campaign you created, it is HIGHLY recommended you set up an alias 
email for this purpose. Recipients are still only eligible for 1 reward per campaign. If you want to do A/B testing and more "advanced" rewards, please check the 
[guide for marketing emails](https://www.fyncom.com/email-forwarding-setup-for-instant-rewards-delivery). Note: These steps are specific to Gmail, 
but similar processes can be used for other email providers

1. On your Gmail home page, click the **gear wheel** in the upper right to access the **setting tab**

   1. [simple@rewards.fyncom.com](mailto:simple@rewards.fyncom.com) <br>
   _Note: This does not start forwarding emails yet. You will need to click a confirmation link which will immediately emailed to you after completing these steps._
      ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/SimpleRewards.png) <br><br>

6. At this point, you will be sent an email with the confirmation link. Open the email and click the link, then select "**Confirm**" on the next page. You should see some
success notification.

   ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/SimpleRewardsEmail-Confirmation.png) <br><br>
   ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/SimpleRewardsEmail-Success.png) <br><br>

7. After you see the success page, please proceed to the "**Filters and Blocked Addresses**" page.
   ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-10.png) <br><br>

8. Select "**Create a new filter**"
   ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-11.png) <br><br>

10. Here is the most important step. In the "**To**" field, enter the email address that should trigger a FynCom reward and then select "**Create filter**".
    1. Keep in mind that FynCom will see all incoming emails to this particular email address. We advise that you create an alias and use that for your marketing
    campaigns. If you are using GMail, [an alias can be made for free](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en) by simply adding "+" and some 
    characters after the "+", but before the ".com"<br>
    For example, if your typical email is "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE@gmail.com)", your alias can be 
    2. "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE+rewards@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE+rewards@gmail.com)" as shown in the image below.
       ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-12.png) <br><br>
 
11. Now, you should see a drop-down menu with a list of checkboxes.
    1. Please select the "**Forward it to:**" checkbox
    2. Hit the drop down arrow and select the "[**rewards@rewards.fyncom.com**](mailto:rewards@rewards.fyncom.com)" email
    3. Select "**Create filter**"
       ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/SImpleRewardsSelection.png) <br><br>

12. If everything went right, you should be taken back to the "**Filters and Blocked Addresses**" page and the newly created filter should appear at the bottom. You can do this for as many alias emails as you want. At this point, you are ready to begin sending rewards for responses to these emails. Now you can go to the [FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) to set up your triggers and values.
