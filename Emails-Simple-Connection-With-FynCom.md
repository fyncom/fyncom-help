# Connecting an Email Address with FynCom for Simple Rewards

--------

**The only emails that will be able to trigger FynCom rewards are the ones you registered in the [FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) or 
invited as employees with ADMIN or WRITE roles.** <br>
_Note 1: This option is best for sales teams sending one-off emails or using CRMs and email sequences. Any emails that go through this process will automatically 
reward any non-automated responses to outbound emails. **It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use an alias email**_.

## Setting up your email forwarding for "Simple Rewards" Email.

_Note 2: Since anyone who replies to this email will receive a reward from the most recent Reward Campaign you created, Please set up an alias email or dedicated 
email for this purpose. Recipients are still only eligible for 1 reward per campaign. If you want to do A/B testing and more "advanced" rewards, please check the 
[guide for marketing emails](https://www.fyncom.com/email-forwarding-setup-for-instant-rewards-delivery)._ <br> 
_Note 3: These steps are specific to Gmail, but similar processes can be used for other email providers._

    ![Select "Create a new filter"](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-11.png) <br><br>

9. Here is the most important step. In the "**To**" field, enter the email address that should trigger a FynCom reward and then select "**Create filter**".
    1. **Reminder**, it is **STRONGLY** advised you create an alias email and use that for your simple email rewards campaigns. If you are using Gmail, 
   [an alias can be made for free](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en) by simply adding "+" and some characters after the "+", but before 
   the ".com"<br>
    For example, if your typical email is "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE@gmail.com)", your alias can be 
   "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE+rewards@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE+rewards@gmail.com)" as shown in the image below. <br>
   ![add your alias email in the TO field and select "Create filter"](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-12.png) <br><br>
 
10. Now, you should see a drop-down menu with a list of checkboxes.
    1. Please select the "**Forward it to:**" checkbox
    2. Hit the drop down arrow and select the "[**send@simple-rewards.fyncom.com**](mailto:send@simple-rewards.fyncom.com)" email
    3. Select "**Create filter**" <br>
       ![Select the checkmark option of "Forward it to" and open the drop down menu to select "send@simple-rewards.fyncom.com". Then select "Create filter"](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/SimpleForwardingEmail-FInal-GmailSetup.png) <br><br>

11. If everything went right, you should be taken back to the "**Filters and Blocked Addresses**" page and the newly created filter should appear at the bottom. 
You can do this for as many alias emails as you want. At this point, you are ready to begin sending emails that automatically reward responses. Now you can go to the 
[FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) to set up your triggers and values.<br>
    ![If you see the filter in your email dashboard as pictured, then you are done!](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/SimpleForwardingEmail-FInal-GmailSetup-Complete.png) <br><br>
