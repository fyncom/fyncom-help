# Connecting Email Address with FynCom

--------

**\*The only emails that will be able to trigger FynCom rewards are the ones you registered in the** [**FynCom dashboard**](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) **, 
as well as their aliases.**

## Setting up your Alias Email (Optional)

Set up an alias email (optional) - Note: These steps are specific to GMail, but similar processes can be used for other email providers

1. On your GMail home page, click the **gear wheel** in the upper right to access the **setting tabs**

   1. [rewards@rewards.fyncom.com](mailto:rewards@rewards.fyncom.com) <br>
   \*Note: This does not start forwarding emails just yet, you will need to enter a code which we will provide to you.

6. At this stage, FynCom support will respond to you with the Confirmation Code, which you should enter into the "**confirmation code**" field. Once that is 
entered, select "**Verify**".

7. After the confirmation code has been entered, please proceed to the "**Filters and Blocked Addresses**" page.
   ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-10.png)

8. Select "**Create a new filter**"

10. Here is the most important step. In the "**To**" field, enter the email address that should trigger a FynCom reward and then select "**Create filter**".
    1. Keep in mind that FynCom will see all incoming emails to this particular email address. We advise that you create an alias and use that for your marketing
    campaigns. If you are using GMail, [an alias can be made for free](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en) by simply adding "+" and some 
    characters after the "+", but before the ".com"<br>
    For example, if your typical email is "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE@gmail.com)", your alias can be 
    2. "[YOUR\_EMAIL\_GOES\_HERE+rewards@gmail.com](mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE+rewards@gmail.com)" as shown in the image below.
       ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-12.png)

11. Now, you should see a drop-down menu with a list of checkboxes.
    1. Please select the "**Forward it to:**" checkbox
    2. Hit the drop down arrow and select the "[**rewards@rewards.fyncom.com**](mailto:rewards@rewards.fyncom.com)" email
    3. Select "**Create filter**"
       ![Go to your email settings to begin your forwarding setup](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/help/fycomhelp-emailh-13.png)

[//]: # (todo update this picture with the actual new email forwaridng address.)
12. If everything went right, you should be taken back to the "**Filters and Blocked Addresses**" page and the newly created filter should appear at the bottom. You can do this for as many alias emails as you want. At this point, you are ready to begin sending rewards for responses to these emails. Now you can go to the [FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) to set up your triggers and values.
