# Zapier setup for FynCom Rewards

--------

**The only accounts that can create FynCom rewards on Zapier are the ones you registered in the [FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/), or
invited as employees with ADMIN or WRITE roles.** <br>
_Note 1: This option requires that you select a Zapier "Trigger" that provides an email of a person whom you wish to reward_.

3. Now, you are ready to create your Zap! Go to [FynCom's Zapier page](https://zapier.com/apps/fyncom/integrations) and choose the app you want to pair FynCom with.
   - For example, try the [Calendly / FynCom Zap](https://zapier.com/shared/d3b8c380ec3e92855d6160075e243e4fc0cab081) to reward people for booking meetings with you.

**&ast;** DO NOT share this API Key with anyone you do not know. Anyone with this Zapier API key can send rewards on your behalf. Each email within your 
organization will have its own API key. As long as your email has ADMIN or WRITE permission, this Zapier API key will permit you to spend from your organization's crypto balance.
