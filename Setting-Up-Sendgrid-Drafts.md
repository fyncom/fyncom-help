# Setting up Sendgrid Drafts

--------

**\*The only emails that will be able to trigger FynCom rewards are the ones you sent from the** [FynCom dashboard](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/) **.**

## Setting up Sendgrid integration

First, please make sure that you or your organization have input your Sendgrid API key through the [FynCom settings page](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/settings#).

### From the Design Library.

One of the preferred ways our organization uses Sendgrid is to create a [Design Template](https://mc.sendgrid.com/design-library/your-designs) email. These are 
reusable templates that can be used to create Marketing Email sends or Transactional Email sends. Here, we&#39;ll use this to create a Marketing Email send.

_**NOTE: You should NOT send from the Sendgrid page, you are only using Sendgrid to design your email so that you can send this draft from your FynCom dashboard.**_

- Navigate to ["Design Library"](https://mc.sendgrid.com/design-library/your-designs) of your Sendgrid account.
    - Click the 3 dots to the right of the name of the template you want to use. (If you don't already have a template here, please create one, then continue with these guidelines)
        - Select "Create Single Send"
            - Select "Design Editor"
                - Advanced users can try the Code Editor, but we prefer the Design Editor for simple, yet powerful email templating.
- At this point, you will be sent to the Sendgrid email design page where you can fine-tune the body of the email. Here, you should update these mandatory fields.
    - Single Send Name
        - This is for your internal records and this will show up in the FynCom dashboard.
    - From Sender
        - This is the email that your recipients will see as the "From" email.
    - Subject
        - This is the subject your recipients will see
    - Send To
        - Select the list of contacts you want this email to go out to.
    - Unsubscribe Group
        - Select the unsubscribe group you want to be associated with this send. 
- Sendgrid will auto-save this draft for you as you work, but just to be safe, click the "Save" button at the top. Do NOT send this yet. [Next, we will go into 
the FynCom dashboard to attach a reward campaign to your draft and then send from your FynCom dashboard.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19K9DL0ahJOlMT2bxzHfp1OsuvOzu7kgdDVIRdz3VOrQ/edit#)
