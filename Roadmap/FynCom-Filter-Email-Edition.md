# A roadmap to features planned and future.

## Whitelisting domains

Certain domains can be trusted more than other. There may be a greater preferrence to hvae these domains be on a whitelist.

* Add Domain whitelisting capability to backend
* Add Domains
  * usps.com
    * __Detect sub-domains__
      * email.informeddelivery.usps.com
  * FoundersNetwork.com
* Add ability to front-end to turn on/off whitelisting for own domain
* Add ability to front-end to turn on/off whitelisting for default domains


## Set up custom PayCation email

Currently, users cannot meaningfully change the content of the autoresponder email that goes out to people who are FynFiltered. Some users may prefer to put their own branding or message to promote themselves, their thoughts, or their business. 

It would be preferrable to keep the base necesities of the FynCom concept in this message (days to respond, refundable deposit amount, "what is fyncom")
* Add ability for users to replace a paragraph of text.
