## What's the best way to use Rewards?
We'll give you a framework to answer this for yourself. This is how customer find success with FynCom and how they start to min/max value/engagment.

### Framework for Rewards Success
Run A/B tests until you get to the smallest value you can offer, while still have a substantial increase in your responses.

1. Run an A/B test #1 to test your outreach campaign with and without a FynCom Reward.
   * Ensure that you make it clear throughout the Rewards sequence that there is an IMMEDIATE incentive available.
2. If you see greater response rates with the test that has a reward (it never fails), then you'll want to run your next A/B Test
3. Run A/B test #2 to compare an outreach campaign with the same Reward from A/B test #1 versus a campaign with 25% of that reward.
   * How do the tests compare with what you're used to? You may find that just the smallest incentive possible makes a substantial difference in 
   your response rates. 

### Why can't you just tell me the answer?
Someday, we will. We run tests daily, but need pioneers like you, testing this in their workflows. It is our goal to be the place you go to,
when you need to know how much it costs on average to get a Director of Marketing at a Series B Software Startup. That comes with scale. The people
who come on this journey with us will be the first to know and will reap benefits throughout the entire journey.

Below are a few of the variables that influence the answer to the question above. 
* Industry
    * Who do you sell to?
* Reputation of your company
    * Does your company have enough brand recognition?
    * Are your ideal customers eager to respond to you when you reach out?
* Maturity of your product / service / feature
    * Is it at product market fit?
    * Is it before product market fit?
* Financial health of your business
    * Does your company print money?
      * Maybe you can afford to be a little more extravagent in the Interactive rewards you offer
