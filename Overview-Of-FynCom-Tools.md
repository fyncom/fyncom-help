# <u>_The FynCom Customer Experience_</u>

## Email Rewards (FynMail)

There are 2 options for rewarding email engagement.

1. **Scalable Emails**
   * The easiest option is to create a Marketing Email through [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) and save it as a draft. Then, once you have logged into your FynCom 
    dashboard, you assign a rewards campaign to the Sendgrid draft + send. <br>
    For this to work, you must provide your Sendgrid API key through your [FynCom settings](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/settings). This method lets you run 
multiple rewards campaigns at the same time.
2. **Simple Emails**
   * Designate a dedicated email address which will be only be used for FynCom marketing campaigns. Anyone who responds to an email from that address gets 
    rewarded the value of the last campaign created. This email address can be used to send conditional rewards with every email you send. <br>
**Note: Only 1 reward campaign can be active at a time.**

## Email Case Study - FynCom &amp; Marketing Executives.

1,000 executives in the Marketing &amp; Advertising space were cold-emailed with information about FynCom. This email contained no language about them 
receiving a reward. A week later, the same 1,000 executives were sent a FynMail, which informed them that they could receive a reward by simply responding. 
This resulted in a 323% increase in positive response rates. Using FynMails is a great way to get your foot in the door and begin a conversation.

## Texts Rewards (FynText)

You can reward someone for responding to a text message. [Slicktext](https://www.slicktext.com/) is our current text message platform of choice. 
More [documentation here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6aD-PduabC7FffhTBFVFvFJe6detAaC3X18RikApj4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Call Rewards (FynCall) - Only ready for fearless early adopters.

This uses a Text/Call/Text system.

1. Recipient receives text message letting them know they will receive a rewards call in 20 minutes
2. You (customer) call them at that time
3. You can set a price per minute ($0.01 / second is a popular choice)
4. They (user) answer the call and their timer begins ticking. The moment the phone gets disconnected, the user is sent a text message letting them know of 
the amount they were paid for this cold call and how they can retrieve their funds.
