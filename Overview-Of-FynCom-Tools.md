## Zapier Rewards

   * Get creative. Customize rewards journeys with FynCom's <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/fyncom/integrations" target="_blank">[Send Email Rewards]</a>  action on Zapier. For any Zapier trigger that has an email address, automate a FynCom reward to be sent to that email. <br>

## Email Rewards (FynMail)

There are 2 options for rewarding email engagement.

1. **Scalable Emails**
   * The easiest option is to create a Marketing Email through <a href="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank">[Sendgrid]</a> and save it as a draft. Then, once you have logged into your FynCom dashboard, you assign a rewards campaign to the Sendgrid draft + send. <br>
    For this to work, you must provide your Sendgrid API key through your <a href="https://dashboard.fyncom.com/settings" target="_blank">[FynCom settings]</a>. This method lets you run multiple rewards campaigns at the same time. 
     * <a href="https://www.fyncom.com/email-forwarding-setup-for-instant-rewards-delivery" target="_blank">[Ready to set up scalable emails? Get started here]</a> 

2. **Simple Emails**
   * Designate a dedicated email address which will be only be used for FynCom marketing campaigns. Anyone who responds to an email from that address gets 
    rewarded the value of the last campaign created. This email address can be used to send conditional rewards with every email you send. <br>
**Note: Only 1 reward campaign can be active at a time.**

## Email Link Clicks

You may choose to reward someone for clicking a link in your email. This option should only be used if you want to drive traffic to a specific landing page. <br>
If interested in this feature, please contact us at support@fyncom.com

## Email Case Study - FynCom &amp; Marketing Executives.

1,000 executives in the Marketing &amp; Advertising space were cold-emailed with information about FynCom. This email contained no language about them 
receiving a reward. A week later, the same 1,000 executives were sent a FynMail, which informed them that they could receive a reward by simply responding. 
This resulted in a 323% increase in positive response rates. Using FynMails is a great way to get your foot in the door and begin a conversation.

## Texts Rewards (FynText)

You can reward someone for responding to a text message. <a href="https://www.slicktext.com/" target="_blank">[Slicktext]</a> is our current text message platform of choice. 
More <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6aD-PduabC7FffhTBFVFvFJe6detAaC3X18RikApj4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[documentation here]</a>.

## Call Rewards (FynCall) - Only ready for fearless early adopters.

This uses a Text/Call/Text system.

1. Recipient receives text message letting them know they will receive a rewards call in 20 minutes
2. You (customer) call them at that time
3. You can set a price per minute ($0.01 / second is a popular choice)
4. They (user) answer the call and their timer begins ticking. The moment the phone gets disconnected, the user is sent a text message letting them know of 
the amount they were paid for this cold call and how they can retrieve their funds.

# <u>_The FynCom User Experience_</u>
Users should use <a href="https://app.fyncom.com" target="_blank">[app.fyncom.com]</a> to use their FynCom Rewards and manage their accounts. FynCom uses 
<a href="https://nano.org/" target="_blank">[nano]</a> for its "FynCom Rewards". Values are shown as US Dollars.

## Gift Card Cashout

Users can log in to the app and purchase the <a href="https://app.fyncom.com/gift" target="_blank">[gift card they want with their FynCom Rewards]</a>. Once they have $5 worth of rewards, 
they can purchase gift cards. Gift card denominations are typically $5, $10, and $25+. Some gift cards will have options for any denomination above $5.

## Cryptocurrency or Cash withdrawal

Users can **withdraw any amount of their FynCom rewards** to keep as nano in their own digital wallets or convert to local cash currency 
through a cryptocurrency exchange platform. <br> _Note: when transferring nano currency between nano accounts, "Withdraw", "Transfer", and "Send" can mean the same thing._
1. **Keep as nano**. _0 fees for withdrawing nano. No minimum limit to withdraw._
    * A <a href="https://nano.org/" target="_blank">[nano account]</a> is automatically assigned to the user's email or phone number when they respond to a FynCom-enabled message. 
    * Users may <a href="https://app.fyncom.com/wallet" target="_blank">[withdraw from their FynCom nano wallet]</a> to their own nano wallets. There are 
      several <a href="https://hub.nano.org/wallets" target="_blank">[mobile and desktop wallets available here]</a>. We highly recommend Natrium for mobile, Nault for desktop, and a
      <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">[nano ledger]</a> for long-term cold storage.<br>
2. **Convert nano to cash**. _You must withdraw your nano to an exchange, exchanges will have their own fees and withdrawal minimums_.
    * Users must create a cryptocurrency exchange account. Here are the <a href="https://hub.nano.org/trading/allows-withdrawals/99/us-dollar-usd/61" target="_blank">[exchanges that convert nano to US Dollars]</a>.
      We highly recommend Kraken for our US friends.
      * Use the "Currencies" tab to see which exchanges work in your country. For example, <a href="https://hub.nano.org/trading/allows-withdrawals/99/euro-eur/103" target="_blank">[Euros]</a>,
        <a href="https://hub.nano.org/trading/allows-withdrawals/99/indian-rupee-inr/120" target="_blank">[Rupees]</a>, and <a href="https://hub.nano.org/trading/allows-withdrawals/99/mexican-peso-mxn/116" target="_blank">[Pesos]</a>.
    * Once you create your exchange account, your exchange will provide you with a nano account that you can use for deposits. You may transfer nano directly 
      from FynCom to your exchange nano's account. However, we recommend that you make 2 transfers since nano transfers have 0-fees and are instantly received.
        * **2 Transfers. Best for people who want to learn about the future of digital currency.** 
          * Transfer 1: <a href="https://app.fyncom.com/wallet" target="_blank">[Send nano from FynCom]</a> to your own nano wallet (see #1 above)
          * Transfer 2: Transfer nano from your nano wallet to your exchange's nano account
        * **1 Transfer. Best for people who just want to keep things simple**
            * Transfer 1: <a href="https://app.fyncom.com/wallet" target="_blank">[Send nano from FynCom]</a> to your exchange's nano account.
