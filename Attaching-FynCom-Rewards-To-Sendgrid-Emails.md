    - Note: If there are any incomplete fields in your draft, the dashboard will let you know with an error message. If you see any of these error messages,
    please go into your Sendgrid account and fix that error for that draft located in your ["Single Sends"](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends?view=raw).

- Now just hit the “Send email” and you’re done!
  - You can see how many people have gotten rewards from your campaigns by using the [“Transactions”](https://dashboard.fyncom.com/campaign/transaction) page in FynCom
  - If you want to see email details like opens, clicks, etc., you can do that through Sendgrid’s campaign details for that particular campaign.
